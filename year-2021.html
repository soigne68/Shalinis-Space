How fascinating is it that time passes by at its normal pace every single day and once we reach to the end of the year, everyone comments,"Kaise beet gaya ek saal, pata hi nahin chala!"</p><p>The year 2021 came with its own challenges and promises. I sincerely thank God for blessing me and my loved ones with health and happiness and pray for this Heavenly benediction to continue in the years to come. I personally found a different meaning to my life this year. It was a rigmarole of events constantly happening almost the same way. In the past few years, my shift from a teacher to an administrator was exceptionally interesting. It was a great learning experience during all those years (on both sides of the table :)). But then, a desire to be my own master was always haunting me. Finally, the month of June 2021 witnessed the change and instead of being an employee, I became an employer. There was constant support from my family and friends and I sincerely thank them for their unflinching faith and confidence in me. It has given me a new level of understanding about my own capabilities.</p><p>As a country also, we have seen innumerable changes and events. There was a time when some people were battling for oxygen and some were hoarding it for emergent times. There were Samaritans who didn't let the faith in humanity die and worked tirelessly to bring hope and cheer in those desperate times. A big salute to all those people! Then we had the best Olympics tally of medals this year with a Gold Medal. India secured 47th position from the 65th position. Indeed a proud moment for all Indians! There were amazing contributions in the field of science and technology also with the unmanned space mission to the moon and launching of a nuclear submarine. The list is endless when we look towards the positive side and so is the list on the other side too. What matters is our perception! The year has given us a new insight with life changing experiences and we must step into 2022 with a new determination and hope. Many people change with the time and then there are a few who change the time. May we be the harbingers of change and bring glory to our being!</p><p>Let's move into 2022 with a resolution. A resolution to be more purposeful, humanitarian and loving. Work is important but it's also imperative to maintain our health. Keep scheduled working hours, visit your family, friends and invest in relations. Appreciate and enjoy the beauty of nature. We get this life once. Make the most of it.</p><p>Goodbye 2021! Welcome 2022....</p><p>Wish you all a very happy and prosperous new year! May it be filled with new adventures, happy times and good fortunes!</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

Whether it be through her early days as a junior teacher, her rise through TGT and PGT certifications, her role as a vice principal or a principal, she truly embodies the spirit of the word “educationist”. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, she runs her latest initiative, ‘Academia’ - an attempt to bring world class English education to Haryana.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until 2021, she was actively involved in the growth and development of students in not only the academic field but also in the games field. Through an inspired combination of training, outreach programs, and general management, she managed to increase the students' interest in both of the fields. A national-level athlete for Haryana herself, she could manage to instill in her students a love for the outdoors. With her diligent tutelage, multiple children were selected for national level games. Her focus on teaching her cohort about sustainable living led her to working with the state government on tree planting initiatives and environmental preservation focused workshops at the school</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Her work was recognized with awards and recognition from the HRD Ministry, as well as frequent facilitations by local TV, radio, and newspaper entities. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking up administration as her primary focus, Shalini was an English teacher at various prestigious organizations in Rajasthan and Haryana. She began her career in 1999 teaching junior classes foundations of the English language. After spending 4 years with young children, she realized that she can make a bigger impact to the general level of education and student growth by working with adolescents, teens, and pre-teens and began teaching at a renowned senior secondary school in Jodhpur. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, she moved back to her home state of Haryana, when she agreed to join O. P. Jindal Modern School, Hisar. She brought her experience and expertise from her previous work and set out to improving the educational foundations of the school. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, while Shalini has held varied titles in varied geographies, her core mission has remained the same for the past 23 years – using education as a tool to improve the society from the ground up. As a student of English as well as Psychology, she understands that the best way to make systemic and lasting improvement is to teach the upcoming generation the best of what we know. That insight coupled with her incessant drive means that she has been delivering results in her field endlessly, and will continue to do so. Fiat lux.</span></p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

Since my childhood, I had a desire to visit Taj Mahal (among other places). One fine day my son announced that we are going to Agra. To be honest, my first expression was of disbelief as we had a plan to go towards the eastern side covering Amritsar, Fazilka and Kartarpur. Going to Agra was like taking a detour but still we did it. Visiting Agra was like a dream come true situation. It was truly an intoxicating moment, when I saw the grand monument of love in all its glory in the morning hours of 28th June.  </p><p>I was speechless and completely blown by its beauty. Undoubtedly, it's the best example of Mughal architecture. The milky white structure was loud in its silence. The magnificent Yamuna river  in the back side added to its charm. It was disturbing to see that the walls were distorted due to unnecessary scribbling by people but then I believe if you can't change something, live with it. I loved each moment that was spent there and while I am writing about it (after around three months), it feels like I am visiting the place again. I have brought that charm with me and live it each day. Taj Mahal is not a place, it's an emotion and anyone who has visited it once with a purity of heart and a sincere desire to be a part of that history can never escape from the indulgence. It's a commitment. It clearly exhibits that love can move mountains. </p><p>We had also visited Akbar's tomb and Fatehpur Sikri. Spread in around 119 acres, the tomb leaves you spell bound with its beauty and architecture. I was completely immersed and mesmerised by the sheer elegance of the place. Visiting his grave in the basement was nothing short of a revealation. One has to pass through a small tunnel kind of structure to reach the grave. The walls are painted in different colours and the whole ambience is breathtaking. The quietness of the place quietens everything and leaves you thinking about the mortality of life. I also came to know that Akbar had designed the architecture of his tomb and the work started in his lifetime. Quite impressive! ...His interest of amalgamating various religions and bringing out the best is aptly portrayed there. We also went to the Kaanch mahal and Jodha Bai's palace. The intricate design and simplicity of the place was par excellence.</p><p>Overall, visiting Agra was a great experience and driving on the Yamuna expressway was an added charm.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6.JPEG" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6-xs.JPEG 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6-sm.JPEG 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6-md.JPEG 768w" alt="" width="3241" height="1956"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C.JPEG" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C-xs.JPEG 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C-sm.JPEG 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C-md.JPEG 768w" alt="" width="3346" height="2194"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685.JPEG" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685-xs.JPEG 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685-sm.JPEG 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685-md.JPEG 768w" alt="" width="3387" height="2241"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63.JPEG" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63-xs.JPEG 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63-sm.JPEG 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63-md.JPEG 768w" alt="" width="3466" height="1475"></figure><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

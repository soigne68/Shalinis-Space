As we move on in life, we come across varied experiences and find that one of the biggest challenges in life is to become comfortable in uncomfortable situations. You step into your greatness only when you decide to step out of your comfort zone. Going by the flow and letting things happen to you will result in anaverage life. It's for us to decide what kind of life we envisage for ourselves.</p><p>I feel, that if our life goal is clear, then we won't have any regrets on the day of judgement. We must understand what we actually require and what requires to be left behind. As soon as we have the clarity of purpose, life will get its meaning. Life has precisely the meaning that we give to it.</p><p>Our priority in life should be to ensure our happiness in our being. Never feel depressed about what people say about you. If you are true to yourself, believe in your actions and can feel proud by the end of the day, then it doesn't matter what people say about you. Take the charge of your life and be successful.</p><p> Don't sit on the comforting couch basking in the glory of your achievements. Each day is a challenge and we must prove our mettle through perseverance. If one fine day, we feel that life is all settled and we need not work hard to improve then it's nothing less then the murder of our better version. We fear changes because they shake our comfort but actually these changes are instrumental in our growth. These days of Covid-19 have taught this to us in the most effective manner. We had never thought of this system of online education and initially there were lot of hiccups and bumpy roads. But now everything has come to a new normal. Old ways don't open new doors. We should be confident to take the risk or lose the chance. </p><p>At times, we learn this lesson the hard way. It's when we lose the opportunity that we grumble over its loss. Take the life by its reins. You are the master of your fate, and the captain of your soul.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 22, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" class="invert" rel="author">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://soigne68.github.io/thought-process.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> It&#x27;s a mind game!</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/all-the-light-we-cannot-see.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> All The Light We Cannot See </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

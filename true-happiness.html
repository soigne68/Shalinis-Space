Just like the sunrise and sunset kind of happiness. All of us can be happy if we centralise the core happiness within ourselves. There was a time that I was so naive that my happiness used to depend on the approval of others. Almost four decades of my life passed in this manner and then I realized that I had given undue importance to others. Slowly and gradually I picked up the pieces of my broken personality and tried to create a new 'me'. Now, I don't look for situations to make me happy. Rather I create my own happiness in my own way and have realized that this is the only way to be. No one should be given the authority to decide your happiness. Find happiness in yourself, in the things that make you happy, leave you contented. You will find that things have suddenly changed for better in your life. Try to remain receptive to what makes you feel happy and trust the process. You will surely reap benefits of your faith.</p><p>As born in a traditional family with 'zero to none' exposure to the outside world, it won't be an exaggeration to say that I knew nothing about the world. My childhood was laced with the proposition that people should be happy with you. Now, this was the major thing that shaped my personality. Being the youngest in the family, I always thought I must please my siblings, I must be good to my parents(which one should), I must make our guests feel at home and so on. You can very well understand that a child won't get any individuality or confidence in such circumstances. I tried to give my best in education and did my graduation with distinction. Now, came the time for post graduation and I was not allowed to go for a subject of my choice(as it was not available in my city). Well, being a subservient person, I followed what came to me. Adding more to the situation, I was married in the second semester of my further education. A new family, new people to deal with. I could have changed to a person who is aware of her requirements but as 'old habits die hard', I was the same in my new environment. And it had its toll on me in the best possible manner(ironically). I somehow completed my post graduation, did the degree course for teaching and started my career as a teacher. But then, God had His own designs and suddenly I was out of the 'Catch-22' situation and left to my own measures. To cut the long story short, I then chose the path which I had always in my mind and here I am with the first hand experience of the after effects of giving too much power and importance to others in your life.</p><p>The reason behind sharing my story is to bring home the clarity to my readers that it's your life. Take the reins in your hands and see the difference that you can make in your life. Loosen your attachments to the people around you, and you will naturally feel more connected to the person inside you. It's very important that we realise (sooner the better) the importance of being your own well-wisher first. In India, this realization is very important for the females, as they are taught to be tolerant, submissive and second to their counter-parts right from their early childhood. Knowing the pain of this, I try to give this understanding to all my acquaintances that no one is big or small. Both the genders have the equal right to carve a niche for themselves. The key to being happy is to know what to let go and what to accept in your life. It's a direction to your life not a destination. </p><p>I always practice gratitude, exercise, meditate and help others. This has helped me to move closer to my goal and find true happiness within myself. Planning a trip and spending quality time with family gives immense happiness.My recent trip to Mumbai and Jodhpur is a testament to this.</p><p> </p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85-xs.jpeg 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85-sm.jpeg 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85-md.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="323" height="404"></figure> <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E-xs.jpeg 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E-sm.jpeg 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E-md.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="323" height="403"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/B564D115-424F-4D3A-AAAE-7228B3E934AF-4.heic" alt=""></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8-xs.jpeg 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8-sm.jpeg 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8-md.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="324" height="431"></figure><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55.jpeg" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55-xs.jpeg 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55-sm.jpeg 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55-md.jpeg 768w" alt="" width="323" height="431"></figure><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

Whatever I have achieved till date Â is all because of their presence in my life. I strongly believe that learning never stops and even after more than five decades of my life I am a curious learner. I have formally left the job in education sector and started my career as an entrepreneur. I am learning the business nuances and thank my children for guiding me at each step, whether it's product management or marketing strategy.</p><p>Â </p><p>My blessings to all my students, who have also helped me in shaping my personality. The students for whom I was a Principal, an English teacher, a Class teacher or a Mentor. It's an amazing feeling to walk down the memory lane and recall the innocent faces of all the children with whom I started my career in 1994. Since then, there is no looking back and I have tutored hundreds and thousands of students in different capacities. Nurturing their high level of energy with utmost passion and dedication and helping them channelize it in a productive manner has always been a challenging (seriouslyâ€¦) and rewarding task. This day gets more significant because many of my old students who are doing great in their lives as engineers, doctors, administrators, defence personnel, businessman or â€¦(list is too longðŸ˜‹) take out time from their schedule and thank me for helping them shape their lives in a better manner. Since morning, I am getting messages from my students and teachers expressing their love and affection. I am truly humbled and overwhelmed. It gives even more sense of responsibility to keep doing my best and raise the bar of excellence.Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Â I wish to suggest the teaching fraternity that you have a very significant role to play in the lives of children. Teaching is not a profession. Itâ€™s a Bhakti (Meditation). You are shaping the future of the world. Try to be a role model for them. They look at you with utmost faith which even surpasses the parentsâ€™ impact. Always practice before you preach. Promote good values, punctiliousness and love for discipline. You have a gift of influencing lives both inside and outside of the classroom. Never give up on your students. This is one such profession, which is a win-win situation for both the stakeholders- teachers and students. Students get the knowledge from their teachers and teachers also learn many things while teaching.Â </p><p>Happy teaching! May we all help each other to become a better version of ourselves!</p><p>Wishing you all health, happiness and success!</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

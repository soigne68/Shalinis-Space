It's in our hands that we paint the canvas of our lives with colours of positivity or the other way round. Colours radiate with dazzling shine when they emanate from the heart. Nature teaches us the beauty of each colour. The rising sun with its orange colour gives warmth and then it's bright yellow colour promises happiness, hope and cheer. It brightens up each and every corner of the earth. The vast sky with it's blue colour gives us peace and calmness. It sends a message that there is no end to posibilities. We only have to set our eyes on our goal and work persistently. Red colour radiates love in all it's forms. The beautiful red rose mesmerises us with it's beauty and fragrance and even when you pluck it, it won't lose it's beauty. Purple colour motivates us to be kind and compassionate and so on...</p><p>The best part is that we have all this in our lives without any prejudice. I feel, we can use this abundance not only to beautify our own life but also to give meaning to our existence. This precious lifetime has more significance, if we impact other lives. Knowingly or unknowingly, we leave a mark on others. Let that be a remarkable one. At times, a small gesture of giving a smile to somebody changes the life course of that person. May be that person required just a reassuring smile to move on. Be that angel in the lives of others. You can make the difference. Life may not be very happening all the time, but remaining grumpy won't solve the problem. You have to move on and see the bright side. There are positives in negatives too. I remember a story that I had read some time back, which talks about a mother and her daughter. The mother was bogged down by the amount of work that she had to do and the daughter was doing her homework of writing a paragraph on "Negative Thanks Giving". The girl was writing about the things, which didn't please her initially but had a rewarding ending. Like the bad medicine which tasted bitter but cured her from the ailment or the final exams which meant holidays are round the corner. The lady could understand that, this amount of work means she has a shelter to live in and people in her life to look after and her whole mind set was changed. We should look at the better part of life and make every day a great day. Why not to make this life a life of gratitude? Because, it will unlock the magnificence of life.   </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 4, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" class="invert" rel="author">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://soigne68.github.io/adventure-is-just-a-moment-away-3.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Adventure is just a moment away!</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/change-is-inevitable.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Change is inevitable </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

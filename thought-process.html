All over the country, people have started talking about the importance of mental health and I feel that is a welcome move. People have come to understand that you are no lesser a human being, if you take expert help to come out of your emotional problems. It's no more a taboo to talk about it. In this time of global pandemic, anxiety, loneliness and frustration are common everywhere, but we have to be ultimate survivors AND WE WILL BE. We have to look for solutions. Problems evolve us as human beings and push us towards a better version of ourselves. What is important in life is that, how we deal with them? What is the meaning we are giving to the problem? If we bow down and surrender, it will grow exponentially and soon we will be the victim of self-sabotage. Each and every thing that we possess can be taken away from us, but our real treasure--our power of thinking and decision making can not be snatched. Even if things go to ashes, and there seems no hope of revival...we can rise from the dust, just like the mythological phoenix. We can bring a paradigm shift in the existing scenario by trying to create positive vibes...first within ourselves and then spreading it in the society at large. </p><p>If we wish to achieve someting in our life. then nothing can deter us. We need to invest our time, mind and energy. We need to train our belief system, because belief shapes our behaviour and behaviour makes the destiny. Be in the company of enthusiastic people, who speak good, practice good and sprinkle the charm of their goodness everywhere. I had read a book (Man's search for meaning) by Dr Viktor Frankl, where he has enumerated the various hardships he had to face in the Nazi concentration camp, during the World War II. He was resilient and visualised a better tomorrow. And he did survive to tell his part of the success story to the world. There are other examples also, where we find exceptional courage and determination to excel. Mountaineer Arunima Sinha is the most glaring example. She was lying on the railway track for the whole night in the most deplorable condition, but her determination was stronger then the problems, and inspite of being amputated below the knee and having a prosthetic leg, she achieved her dream of hoisting national flag on Mount Everest. When people can come out from such dire situations, then it's not difficult for us too. We just have to maintain hygiene, keep social distance and remain at home. This shall also pass.</p><p>I have realised that there are unlimited possibilities to recreate, reinvent and reenergise ourselves in this Lockdown period. All we have to do is to decide for a better tomorrow. Take this time as a time to put reset button. I feel that if we have the half glass full attitude, then we we will be able to sail through all odds. Don't feel scared with the magnanimity of the problem, rather face it head on and I am sure you will succeed. Be confident about yourself, plan and priortise your goals, set a timeline and work towards it. There cannot be any force stopping you to achieve your dreams.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 25, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" class="invert" rel="author">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://soigne68.github.io/a-tiny-step.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> A tiny step</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

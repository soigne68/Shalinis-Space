We start believing that to be the truth of life and expect no escape. We don't even feel that something is missing and some concrete action is required to bring in the much needed change. Constant pressure of work, life, relationships, society and what not... is being harped upon in a continuous process. And we don't even realize the light within, which has the ultimate power to transmute the mundane into magical.</p><p>This was the scenario of my life also around four months back. When I was a self proclaimed victim of extreme work and pressure. But, since the day I have actively started reading books...once again...I find a tremendous change in the thought process. There seems to be a complete overhaul of the system. And, mind you, it feels good. The words of Francis Bacon resound in my mind and I quote,'Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man". This world of books has given a new perspective to life. Recently, I have read the book, All the light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr and it has completely changed my idea about blind people. Marie Laure, the main character of the story is blind, but the way she persevers and sustains in life is mind boggling. Her blindness never impedes her way to achieve excellence. The words, <em>Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever,</em> have left an everlastng impression on me. It's true that it doesn't matter how many resources we have unless and until we know how to use them. Time is a very crucial thing and it goes without saying that once you lose hold of it, it almost gets impossible to catch the strings. Another character of the story, Werner, is an exceptionally intelligent boy with mechanical, technical and scientific knowledge. He was an orphan but his fascination to see the invisible waves took him to places. There is such a realistic presentation of the brutality of Nazi's and the traumatic experience of fleeing to other countries for peace, that at times it leaves you in pieces. </p><p>I could feel the light within each word and each expression of the book. Anthony Doerr has certainly found a place in  the list of my favourite writers. While reading the book, there were times, when I caught myself just staring at the words and drowning in the memories of my visit to Auschwitz (Krakow, Poland), where I could see the gas chambers and the depth of brutality by Hitler Army. </p><p>Now, that I am reading a book/week, I will put my reviews here, so that my readers may also get interested to delve deeper into the world of books.</p><p>It's a beautiful world. Let's weave each day with good ideas, plan each move for betterment and see the light within!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 7, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" class="invert" rel="author">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://soigne68.github.io/setting-priorities.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Setting Priorities</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/adventure-is-just-a-moment-away-3.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Adventure is just a moment away! </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

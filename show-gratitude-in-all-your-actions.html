Practicing this turns the excruciating pain of difficult times into tolerable ones. We shouldn't be deterred by the unfavourable events taking place in our lives, as these events only bring out our real resilient self into full projection. Even if the things are going wrong, set your vibrations into the tuning mode of your choice and see the difference. I know for a fact that it's easy said being done. But believe me, once you practice this art, you will find a different meaning to your life. </p><p>Let me give you a quick example. Around a decade ago, there came a night that seemed to loom larger then my existence. I was left devastated, broken and shattered by circumstances. I had my children with me and that was the only sunshine in the otherwise pitch dark scenario. I thanked God for what I had and tried to move on. I won't lie. I did cry in the initial phase but time is a great healer. It taught me that the  universe aligns us with people, things and situations. If there is something that is not required in our life, universe conspires to throw it out of the system. It may take time but it will definitely work for our betterment. Today, when I look back, I thank God for chartering this path for me. I bow my head in complete reverence to Him for blessing me with two mature individuals as my children. What troubled me didn't vanish suddenly, but I moved out of my tunnel vision of looking at things and tried to broaden my horizon into the periphery of my life where amazing things were happening in different manners.  We only need to arrange or orchestrate the things for desired results. There comes a time when you realise that everything that you've gone through was actually a blessing in disguise.</p><p>When we are building ourselves for a better tomorrow, there shouldn't be any time to dwell on the small little things actually petty things of yesterday. Make gratitude a fundamental feature of your existence. Right in the morning when you open your eyes, thank God for blessing you with a new day and promise yourself to do the best you can to make the day a remarkable one. When you sleep at night thank all those people in your heart, who helped you to achieve your goals during the day. It's a very healing exercise. If you can thank people in person, don't lose the chance. You never know you may not get the opportunity again. There goes a story about a man whose life was saved only because he had the habit of thanking the security guard before leaving for the day. One day he was locked in his office and couldn't reach anyone for help. The security guard raised an alarm about it because he hadn't seen him going and saved his life. </p><p>Every person is struggling his or her own battle. We should try to be kind and generous in all our ways and means. As we navigate the highs and lows in life, the love and compassion we share with others gives the direction and brightness to life. Let this journey be a journey of healing and make this world a better place to live. I thank you all for being there with me.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" class="invert" rel="author">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://soigne68.github.io/change-is-inevitable.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Change is inevitable</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Publii Static CMS</a></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

It has reiterated my conviction that, "The world is not in your books and maps. It's out there". We need to have that spirit of moving out from our comfort zone and explore the unknown.</p><p>This journey started with my picking the book "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkiens. It's a fantasy novel for children and when I laid my hands on it, I was wondering about the experience. I was not sure about it's completion. It all started with a doubt and a light hearted desire to read a novel for children, which had won acclaim all over the world. It was indeed an unforgettable journey. The main character- Bilbo Baggins, is presented as the most complacent creature, living a pretty average life in his hole. But once he was challenged for an adventure and the way he fought with Smaug (dragon) single handedly to reclaim the lost treasure, it simply projects him as the real hero. We can't say that he reclaimed his lost power, because he got the power which he didn't know he had. He was in complete amazement with himself because slaying the huge spider or fighting with the slimy Gollum without the help of Gandalf (wizard) or dwarves was a nightmare for him. He realized that - Happiness lies in knowing our worth. The fiercer and bolder Hobbit found a new meaning to life.</p><p>It cemented my belief that the ability to take action in the face of fear is the most crucial thing. Rest happens automatically. Once you win the battle with your mind then no force can stop you to scale greater heights. Most of the times we are slaves to our own inhibitions and don't allow ourselves to step out and take the challenge. What is most important in life is the faith in our abilities. We live in a society where most of the times,  our roles are pre-defined and we also believe in our limited capacity. We just have to break free the shackles and build a new pesona. President Roosevelt's words are very apt to quote here," The only thing we have to fear is...fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance".</p><p>There is one more instance where Tolkien has truly presented a great idea. It was when Gandalf along with Thorin and company (dwarves) persuaded Baggins for the adventure.</p><p>Baggins asked,"<em><strong>You can promise that I'll come back?</strong></em>"</p><p>And Gandalf answered, <em><strong>"No. And if you do, you'll not be the same."</strong></em></p><p>What a beautiful interpretation! It actually stirs a positive thought process. And yes, it proved right, because Baggins was a changed creature after the sinister fight. He had shown extreme mental fortitude when he gave the Arkenstone (Stone which gives you the infinite powers) to the army of men and elves instead of his comrades, so that the damaging war and bloodshed can be avoided. Later on risking his own safety, he returned to his people with a deep loyalty. His transformation from a shy and timid creature to a true hero is a classic example of fighting your own battles. </p><p>I recommend this book to those who can appreciate the subtleness of ideas. The dialogues are comical and hilarious at times, targetting the readers for whom it was originally written, but they do add to the overall beauty of the book.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

We reached Amman, capital city of this Middle Eastern country – Jordan, in the wee hours of 17<sup>th</sup> November. It was quite an overwhelming moment. Everything was smooth till our landing and then the Airport authorities thought of picking me and my daughter (Aditi) for complete scrutinizing of documents and purpose of our visit. Although, we had all the papers but being in a different country gives you the goosebumps. To add to our plight, we had a language barrier. Google translator app came to our rescue, and we could convince the officials of our visit. Now, to add more to our experience, it turned out that our luggage hadn’t reached Amman. We had to wait for two days to get our luggage. We had only our handbags with us, and we went to the hotel. Well, now with hindsight, I feel that was an interesting experience. Living life with minimalistic things:).</p>\n<p>We stayed in Arab Tower Hotel in Amman. It was a good hotel with pleasing and helpful staff members. And the best part was that we could see the Roman theater from our room. There was an interesting mix of graffiti and strange street art on the walls of buildings. We had a stay of four days in Amman. As Abhishek (my son)had already visited the place, he made a remarkable itinerary to get the best out of these four days. First, we went to see the Amman Citadel National Historic Site. From there we could see the beautiful panoramic view of the city. It has the temple of Hercules, Byzantine Church, the Umayyad Palace, and the Jordan Archaeological Museum. There were colossal remains of the great statue of the Roman Hero – Hercules, including his hand and pillars. There were inscriptions all around to tell us that it dates to 160 CE. The Palace was built during the Umayyad dynasty and is mostly in ruins due to an earthquake. The Byzantine church had its pillars; mosaic covered floors and floor plan. It was a very captivating sight to behold such precision and art in its basic form. We couldn’t go to the museum but had a fair deal of archeological sites in our list.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/FullSizeRender.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/FullSizeRender-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/FullSizeRender-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/FullSizeRender-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"349\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/DSC02729.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/DSC02729-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/DSC02729-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/DSC02729-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\"></figure>\n<p>Next day we went to the Roman theater early morning before leaving for Jerash. The theater was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius, when the city was under the control of Romans and was called Philadelphia. The curved stairs gave a magnanimous view. It could accommodate 6000 people at a time. It had been my long pending desire to visit Roman Theater and once it got fulfilled, it was an exhilarating moment for me. There were two museums adjacent to the theater on both sides. One was Jordanian Museum of Popular Traditions and other one was Jordan Folklore Museum. It really gave a sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p> Jerash city is in ruins, but it’s preserved in the best possible manner. Luckily, it’s not crowded with tourists, and we could visit each site with ease. The temple of Artemis was built inside a gigantic courtyard. The Oval Forum is also an iconic ruin with a huge line of high columns, up to 8 mt. height. The Northern and Southern theaters provide a marvelous view. There was a Hippodrome within the ruins of Jerash, which was built for Roman horse chariots. It’s a spectacular experience of witnessing history that’s left behind. The temple of Zeus was another site which was ruined due to an earthquake.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/DSC02747.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/DSC02747-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/DSC02747-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/DSC02747-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"353\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/IMG_4709.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4709-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4709-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4709-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\"></figure>\n<p>Next day, we went to the Jordan Syria border and had a good experience of meeting people of two different nationalities. Inspite of the language barrier, we could feel the warmth of their heart. In the evening we went to Gadara and Irbid, where we could see two nations  Egypt and Israel in front of us.Having a sip of Bedouin coffee watching these two nations was fantastic. Last day in Amman was devoted to the Dead Sea. It’s  the saltiest lake along with being the lowest water body on earth. It was an amazing experience with the vast expanse of the Dead Sea on one side and Jordanian hills on the other. Taking a car for all these days was the best decision and such road trips add more to the overall feel. The weather was perfect for our visit and we could successfully float in the water. I remember, when I was stepping in the water and it took me in for a second, I had the scariest of all experiences. I knew that I won’t drown, but the love of life, you know…Later on , I floated (body’s buoyancy),  for half an hour in the sea and thoroughly enjoyed. Best water experience ever (and the only one too;).</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"1\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/gallery/IMG_5434.jpeg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/gallery/IMG_5434-thumbnail.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/IMG_4987.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4987-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4987-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4987-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"655\" height=\"491\"></figure>\n<p> Before I move ahead, the foodie in me must mention the Rainbow Street and Mijana Café, which has a part of my heart left there. It serves the world’s best bread and hummus. We couldn’t stop ourselves from going there again and again. Another interesting eating joint was Hashem.  Falafel, kunafa , baklava, harrisa, mansaf and the list goes on. The Bedouin coffee was an added extravaganza to the sumptuous meal everytime.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/IMG_5365.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_5365-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_5365-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_5365-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"2268\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/IMG_4950.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4950-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4950-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/22/responsive/IMG_4950-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"666\" height=\"375\"></figure>\n<p>Well, this is the end of part 1 of our Jordan trip.

            "content_html": "<p>It's time to share my experience of visiting Taj mahal and nearby areas (something that I had promised two posts back:) ).  That trip was like a magical experience. Since my childhood, I had a desire to visit Taj Mahal (among other places). One fine day my son announced that we are going to Agra. To be honest, my first expression was of disbelief as we had a plan to go towards the eastern side covering Amritsar, Fazilka and Kartarpur. Going to Agra was like taking a detour but still we did it. Visiting Agra was like a dream come true situation. It was truly an intoxicating moment, when I saw the grand monument of love in all its glory in the morning hours of 28th June.  </p>\n<p>I was speechless and completely blown by its beauty. Undoubtedly, it's the best example of Mughal architecture. The milky white structure was loud in its silence. The magnificent Yamuna river  in the back side added to its charm. It was disturbing to see that the walls were distorted due to unnecessary scribbling by people but then I believe if you can't change something, live with it. I loved each moment that was spent there and while I am writing about it (after around three months), it feels like I am visiting the place again. I have brought that charm with me and live it each day. Taj Mahal is not a place, it's an emotion and anyone who has visited it once with a purity of heart and a sincere desire to be a part of that history can never escape from the indulgence. It's a commitment. It clearly exhibits that love can move mountains. </p>\n<p>We had also visited Akbar's tomb and Fatehpur Sikri. Spread in around 119 acres, the tomb leaves you spell bound with its beauty and architecture. I was completely immersed and mesmerised by the sheer elegance of the place. Visiting his grave in the basement was nothing short of a revealation. One has to pass through a small tunnel kind of structure to reach the grave. The walls are painted in different colours and the whole ambience is breathtaking. The quietness of the place quietens everything and leaves you thinking about the mortality of life. I also came to know that Akbar had designed the architecture of his tomb and the work started in his lifetime. Quite impressive! ...His interest of amalgamating various religions and bringing out the best is aptly portrayed there. We also went to the Kaanch mahal and Jodha Bai's palace. The intricate design and simplicity of the place was par excellence.</p>\n<p>Overall, visiting Agra was a great experience and driving on the Yamuna expressway was an added charm.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6.JPEG\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6-xs.JPEG 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6-sm.JPEG 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/551AC28B-FD46-4B09-B58A-54D5C3686FB6-md.JPEG 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3241\" height=\"1956\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C.JPEG\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C-xs.JPEG 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C-sm.JPEG 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/985CE79E-64CC-4BB2-B979-D520FA2AA33C-md.JPEG 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3346\" height=\"2194\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685.JPEG\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685-xs.JPEG 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685-sm.JPEG 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/B0BF7AE6-0183-40EE-987C-FD78C0BAA685-md.JPEG 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3387\" height=\"2241\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63.JPEG\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63-xs.JPEG 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63-sm.JPEG 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/20/responsive/E08DD7CD-0F24-491E-B2E3-7114352E8A63-md.JPEG 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3466\" height=\"1475\"></figure>",

Whatever I have achieved till date  is all because of their presence in my life. I strongly believe that learning never stops and even after more than five decades of my life I am a curious learner. I have formally left the job in education sector and started my career as an entrepreneur. I am learning the business nuances and thank my children for guiding me at each step, whether it's product management or marketing strategy.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>My blessings to all my students, who have also helped me in shaping my personality. The students for whom I was a Principal, an English teacher, a Class teacher or a Mentor. It's an amazing feeling to walk down the memory lane and recall the innocent faces of all the children with whom I started my career in 1994. Since then, there is no looking back and I have tutored hundreds and thousands of students in different capacities. Nurturing their high level of energy with utmost passion and dedication and helping them channelize it in a productive manner has always been a challenging (seriously…) and rewarding task. This day gets more significant because many of my old students who are doing great in their lives as engineers, doctors, administrators, defence personnel, businessman or …(list is too long😋) take out time from their schedule and thank me for helping them shape their lives in a better manner. Since morning, I am getting messages from my students and teachers expressing their love and affection. I am truly humbled and overwhelmed. It gives even more sense of responsibility to keep doing my best and raise the bar of excellence. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> I wish to suggest the teaching fraternity that you have a very significant role to play in the lives of children. Teaching is not a profession. It’s a Bhakti (Meditation). You are shaping the future of the world. Try to be a role model for them. They look at you with utmost faith which even surpasses the parents’ impact. Always practice before you preach. Promote good values, punctiliousness and love for discipline. You have a gift of influencing lives both inside and outside of the classroom. Never give up on your students. This is one such profession, which is a win-win situation for both the stakeholders- teachers and students. Students get the knowledge from their teachers and teachers also learn many things while teaching. </p>\n<p>Happy teaching! May we all help each other to become a better version of ourselves!</p>\n<p>Wishing you all health, happiness and success!</p>",

We could cover 4 borders (Kartarpur, Wagah, Hussainiwala and Fazilka) with Pakistan in 4 days. Incredible indeed! </p>\n<p>Today when I am writing this blog, the memories of visiting the partition museum in Amritsar come alive in my heart. We bask in the glory of independence, but we should never forget the sacrifices of those unsung heroes who had to suffer inconsolably. I had heard the real-life accounts of people who shared that their destinies were changed overnight due to a line drawn by Cyril Radcliffe. The drawing of the boundary proved to be extremely controversial for thousands and thousands of families as they found themselves uprooted from a land which they had inhabited for generations. It was very painful to watch and hear those accounts. But I appreciate the fact that the museum has kept the essence alive and only an insensitive soul can fail to feel the pain.</p>\n<p>I had heard a lot about Wagah border and went their with a lot of enthusiasm. It was a good experience but when I visited Hussainiwala border, it superseded all rankings. I could feel the pulse of patriotism in each and every person there. There was amazing coordination and camaraderie in the soldiers from both the countries. The ceremonial gestures of showing their valour and power were captivating. The soldiers exchanged their positions during the ‘Retreat Ceremony’, which means Indian soldier went to Pakistan's side and Pakistani soldier came to India's side. This was a unique moment as the National flags of both the countries were lowered before the dusk. Fazilka border ceremony was also energising. The energy and ferocity of soldiers in all the border ceremonies was contagious. People were taking selfies with soldiers, regarding them as heroes and feeling proud to be there. No doubt, our real heroes are the soldiers of the country. I salute them and pay my respect for all the sacrifices they make for us. </p>\n<p>I must talk about Kartarpur corridor separately, because that was the highlight of the visit.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image align-center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A.png\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A-xs.png 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A-sm.png 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A-md.png 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"3413\" height=\"1276\"></figure>\n<p>We had applied for the visit very well in advance and got police verification done. I was personally very excited for this as we were going to Pakistan- our own land before partition. Once we reached the corridor, we passed through all custom formalities and entered Pakistan. The people were very hospitable and the shrine was mesmerising. This is the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is said that Guru Nanak ji did farming in this area till the time of his eternal sleep. His three principles of <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirat_Karo\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Kirat Karo</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naam_Japo\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Naam Japo</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vand_Chhako\" style=\"color: #000000;\">Wand Chako</a>,</em></span>( work hard for a livelihood, keep remembering the God and share your blessings with the world) are the real teachings. The place is huge and very well maintained. I feel blessed to get an opportunity to go there and would love to visit again. The peace and tranquillity of the place was matchless.

            "content_html": "<p>Happiness has different meanings for different people. Just like the sunrise and sunset kind of happiness. All of us can be happy if we centralise the core happiness within ourselves. There was a time that I was so naive that my happiness used to depend on the approval of others. Almost four decades of my life passed in this manner and then I realized that I had given undue importance to others. Slowly and gradually I picked up the pieces of my broken personality and tried to create a new 'me'. Now, I don't look for situations to make me happy. Rather I create my own happiness in my own way and have realized that this is the only way to be. No one should be given the authority to decide your happiness. Find happiness in yourself, in the things that make you happy, leave you contented. You will find that things have suddenly changed for better in your life. Try to remain receptive to what makes you feel happy and trust the process. You will surely reap benefits of your faith.</p>\n<p>As born in a traditional family with 'zero to none' exposure to the outside world, it won't be an exaggeration to say that I knew nothing about the world. My childhood was laced with the proposition that people should be happy with you. Now, this was the major thing that shaped my personality. Being the youngest in the family, I always thought I must please my siblings, I must be good to my parents(which one should), I must make our guests feel at home and so on. You can very well understand that a child won't get any individuality or confidence in such circumstances. I tried to give my best in education and did my graduation with distinction. Now, came the time for post graduation and I was not allowed to go for a subject of my choice(as it was not available in my city). Well, being a subservient person, I followed what came to me. Adding more to the situation, I was married in the second semester of my further education. A new family, new people to deal with. I could have changed to a person who is aware of her requirements but as 'old habits die hard', I was the same in my new environment. And it had its toll on me in the best possible manner(ironically). I somehow completed my post graduation, did the degree course for teaching and started my career as a teacher. But then, God had His own designs and suddenly I was out of the 'Catch-22' situation and left to my own measures. To cut the long story short, I then chose the path which I had always in my mind and here I am with the first hand experience of the after effects of giving too much power and importance to others in your life.</p>\n<p>The reason behind sharing my story is to bring home the clarity to my readers that it's your life. Take the reins in your hands and see the difference that you can make in your life. Loosen your attachments to the people around you, and you will naturally feel more connected to the person inside you. It's very important that we realise (sooner the better) the importance of being your own well-wisher first. In India, this realization is very important for the females, as they are taught to be tolerant, submissive and second to their counter-parts right from their early childhood. Knowing the pain of this, I try to give this understanding to all my acquaintances that no one is big or small. Both the genders have the equal right to carve a niche for themselves. The key to being happy is to know what to let go and what to accept in your life. It's a direction to your life not a destination. </p>\n<p>I always practice gratitude, exercise, meditate and help others. This has helped me to move closer to my goal and find true happiness within myself. Planning a trip and spending quality time with family gives immense happiness.My recent trip to Mumbai and Jodhpur is a testament to this.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/8FBF4D45-00A1-4FA3-832B-2B036BE2BA85-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"404\"></figure> <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/90F8883E-8AB5-47D8-95D6-3B2EF322304E-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"403\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/B564D115-424F-4D3A-AAAE-7228B3E934AF-4.heic\" alt=\"\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/0354890E-DAC5-4AF0-B90E-4A13D22493C8-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"324\" height=\"431\"></figure><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55.jpeg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw\" srcset=\"https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/14/responsive/B7E92574-8928-4A5E-ACAC-8AD589867A55-md.jpeg 768w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"323\" height=\"431\"></figure>",

Through an inspired combination of training, outreach programs, and general management, she managed to increase the students' interest in both of the fields. A national-level athlete for Haryana herself, she could manage to instill in her students a love for the outdoors. With her diligent tutelage, multiple children were selected for national level games. Her focus on teaching her cohort about sustainable living led her to working with the state government on tree planting initiatives and environmental preservation focused workshops at the school</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

She began her career in 1999 teaching junior classes foundations of the English language. After spending 4 years with young children, she realized that she can make a bigger impact to the general level of education and student growth by working with adolescents, teens, and pre-teens and began teaching at a renowned senior secondary school in Jodhpur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2011, she moved back to her home state of Haryana, when she agreed to join O.

As a student of English as well as Psychology, she understands that the best way to make systemic and lasting improvement is to teach the upcoming generation the best of what we know. That insight coupled with her incessant drive means that she has been delivering results in her field endlessly, and will continue to do so. Fiat lux. </span></p>",

Many a time, working parents are not able to give quality time to their children or pin point the root cause of their alienated behaviour. The role of guidance counsellors comes to the forefront in these situations. Guidance counsellors helps them to react to situations by developing new strategies and dealing with them in an efficacious manner. Counsellors render a professional service to the individuals who are facing some problem and needs help to overcome it. Guidance and counselling is oriented to help students understand themselves, become self-sufficient in making realistic and positive selections and grow in human relationships and concerns.

Guidance sessions advise the children about selection of courses and different career opportunities, enabling them to make proper and informed choices for their future. It's important to prepare children for life after school and what to expect in the different fields they might opt for. Professional guidance helps the students to achieve their goals in the best possible manner. It not only helps them to take decisions pertaining to their career, but it also makes them confident and mentally prepares them for the challenges. They acquire knowledge, attitude and inter-personal skills to set their own goals and take their own decisions to achieve those goals. Along with their academic and career development, their social and personal development is also taken care of. Guidance and counselling makes students better informed individuals.</p>\n<p>All over the world children are under extreme stress and anxiety due to performance issues. In India, the education system focusses more on quantitative learning with long school hours, heavy school bags and rote learning which leads to lesser creativity and innovation in the teaching and learning process. Now-a-days some educational institutions have come up with more technology based teaching, but there is a long way to go. Let us join hands to bring more quality to the education system with structured guidance and counselling to all the three stake holders of the education system, i.e. students, parents and teachers.</p>",

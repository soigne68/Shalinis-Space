We strive hard to remain in our comfort zone and resist all changes. As a result, our growth doesn't reach to its full bloom. We condition ourselves to a stagnant life  and as a consequence live a life like the Dead Sea. The Sea of Galilee also receives the water from the same source (Jordan river), but is resplendent with flourishing flora and fauna, only because it allows the water to come and go. On the other hand the Dead Sea retains the water and ultimately annihilates all chances of life. The most important feature that we need to understand is that change brings a new sunshine everywhere. Nature is the best example here.</p><p>These changes, whether internal/external teach us something new. Most of the times external changes propel us to make a shift in the internal programming, which inturn brings a change in our behaviour, our thinking and reacting to any situation. For personal growth, it's important to bring voluntary changes in our lives, by embracing new challenges with resilience and power. To become a better version of ourselves, we must work internally like the Chinese Bamboo (which takes years to show the first sign of life, but when it does, it dazzles the whole world with its phenomenal growth).</p><p>As a human being, we get anxious with change. And it's quite natural too, because we have been wired like this from the starting. I am not suggesting that we should change everything, but we must give sometime to ourselves and ask-Where do I want to be five/ten years down the line? If the answer is different from your your current lifestyle then gear up to change because merely wishing won't manifest the desire into reality. Set up a long term goal and break it into small achievable goals and then work with patience and persistence to achieve them with panache. </p><p>Set your principles in tune with your goals to guide you better. You don't know how something will turn out when you act, but you do know whether this action is in line with your principles or not. Show strength in dealing with whatever outcome and you will find yourself in a better position. For example, some of my guiding principles are to become an entrepreneur, travel worldwide, to read and write extensively, build trust and create a better society. To achieve these, I had to make some changes in my thought process. Leaving a regular job with a regular paycheck is risky but liberating and profound. I have committed to myself to achieve all these goals in this lifetime only.</p><p>Being true and honest, to one's own self is very important to reach the desired position. At times, we don't know the nuances of many things. Be a learner there, instead of diving headfirst in the unknown waters. Update your skills, have faith and be the CHANGE. </p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div><div class="post__bio"><h3><a href="https://soigne68.github.io/authors/shalini-chaudhary/" title="Shalini Chaudhary">Shalini Chaudhary</a></h3></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://soigne68.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');

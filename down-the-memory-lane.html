We could cover 4 borders (Kartarpur, Wagah, Hussainiwala and Fazilka) with Pakistan in 4 days. Incredible indeed! </p><p>Today when I am writing this blog, the memories of visiting the partition museum in Amritsar come alive in my heart. We bask in the glory of independence, but we should never forget the sacrifices of those unsung heroes who had to suffer inconsolably. I had heard the real-life accounts of people who shared that their destinies were changed overnight due to a line drawn by Cyril Radcliffe. The drawing of the boundary proved to be extremely controversial for thousands and thousands of families as they found themselves uprooted from a land which they had inhabited for generations. It was very painful to watch and hear those accounts. But I appreciate the fact that the museum has kept the essence alive and only an insensitive soul can fail to feel the pain.</p><p>I had heard a lot about Wagah border and went their with a lot of enthusiasm. It was a good experience but when I visited Hussainiwala border, it superseded all rankings. I could feel the pulse of patriotism in each and every person there. There was amazing coordination and camaraderie in the soldiers from both the countries. The ceremonial gestures of showing their valour and power were captivating. The soldiers exchanged their positions during the ‘Retreat Ceremony’, which means Indian soldier went to Pakistan's side and Pakistani soldier came to India's side. This was a unique moment as the National flags of both the countries were lowered before the dusk. Fazilka border ceremony was also energising. The energy and ferocity of soldiers in all the border ceremonies was contagious. People were taking selfies with soldiers, regarding them as heroes and feeling proud to be there. No doubt, our real heroes are the soldiers of the country. I salute them and pay my respect for all the sacrifices they make for us. </p><p>I must talk about Kartarpur corridor separately, because that was the highlight of the visit.</p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A.png" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A-xs.png 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A-sm.png 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/236BAE81-8558-4B3F-8462-E5D7886BD40A-md.png 768w" alt="" width="3413" height="1276"></figure><p>We had applied for the visit very well in advance and got police verification done. I was personally very excited for this as we were going to Pakistan- our own land before partition. Once we reached the corridor, we passed through all custom formalities and entered Pakistan. The people were very hospitable and the shrine was mesmerising. This is the final resting place of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. It is said that Guru Nanak ji did farming in this area till the time of his eternal sleep. His three principles of <span style="color: #000000;"><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirat_Karo" style="color: #000000;">Kirat Karo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naam_Japo" style="color: #000000;">Naam Japo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vand_Chhako" style="color: #000000;">Wand Chako</a>,</em></span>( work hard for a livelihood, keep remembering the God and share your blessings with the world) are the real teachings. The place is huge and very well maintained. I feel blessed to get an opportunity to go there and would love to visit again. The peace and tranquillity of the place was matchless. The next best part was the Nishan Sahib market. I got many souvenirs from there and the best one is this.</p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/IMG_4147.png" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_4147-xs.png 300w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_4147-sm.png 480w, https://soigne68.github.io/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_4147-md.png 768w" alt="" width="405" height="540"></figure><p>The post will be too long, if I talk about all the places in one go.
